DOM - Document Object Model

The DOM connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing
the struture of a document - such as the HTML representing a web page - in memory.
Usually it refers to Javascript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents
as objects are not part of the core Javascript language.

The DOM represents a document with a locgical tree. Each branch of the tree ends 
in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programatic access
to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, 
the event handlers get executed.

HTML DOM

Document interface -> Element interface -> HTMLElement + subclasses

A document containing HTML is decribed using the Document interface, which is extended
by the HTML specification to include various HTML-specific features. In particular, 
the Element interface is enhanced to become HTMLElement and various subclasses, 
each representing one of (or a family of closely related) elements.

The HTML DOM API provides access to various browser features such as tabs and windows,
CSS styles and stylesheets, browser history, and so forth.
